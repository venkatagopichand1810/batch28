javascript is single threaded(sync)...meaning it will execute only one task at the given time.

event loop, we can do asynchronous task..non-blocking..

callback -> callback hell -> promise -> promise chaining -> async await -> fetch -> error handling


callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then called inside the outer function 

promise in js represent completion or failure of an operation

1) resolve
2) reject
3) pending

api ....resolve
reject
pending..
