variable is the names storage for data.. 
box -> where we are putting some information, we can acccess name or we can change information

why do we need variables 

-> to store the data 
-> to resuse the values without typing them again
-> it will make our program flexible and dynamic

var mobileNumber = "987888899" -> backend -> databas

if mobilenumber = 987888899 -> proceed for the login

in javascript -> there are three ways to declare the variables
--- var -> we have only var
---- let 
---- const



//var, let, const---global scope

//var---
reassginemnet is possible 
redeclartion is possible 
function scope, even though inside the block {} we can able to access the variables which are declared outside

var a = 100
if(true){
    var a = 10;
}
console.log(a); //possible


//let
redeclartion is not possible
reassginemnet is possible 
block scope, we cannot able to access the value which delcared inside the block in outside

let value = 100;
if(true){
    let a = 10;
}
console.log(a); //not possible


//const
redeclartion is not possible
reassginemnet is not possible 
declaration and assginment should happen in the same line
block scope, we cannot able to access the value which delcared inside the block in outside

const name = "venkat"
if(true){
    const a = 10;
}
console.log(a); //not possible
