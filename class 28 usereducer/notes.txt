useReducer hook is used to maintain the complex state of the application in react

const[state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

state: The current state of the application
dispatch: we are going to dispatch an action to change the state
reducer: (state, action) => newState... it will simply tell to react how to update the state
initialState: the starting value of the state


reducer is a function which holds state and action...based on the action type,  state will change

: state, action...based up on the action, state will update
