usememo is hook that is used to memoizes the result of the function so that it will avoid the recalculation()

to avoid unnecessary re-renders and it is used to avoid recomputing of the heavy calculations


const person = {
    name: "venkat", 
    addres : {
        street: {
            zip: "523155"
        }
    }
}



uncontrolled forms: inputs are handled directly by the DOM itself, useRef to access the values
